we are going to create a movie-app where you can present your favorite movies or series. We will also be able to use the react hooks.
Components:
-MovieCard
-MovieList
-Filter ( title, rate)
Every movie should have the following attributes:title, description, posterUrl, rate
The user should be:
Able to add a new movie
Filter the movies with title/ rate
We will add a description and a trailer link (embed video link) to the object movie
Every time, I click on a movie card, it will take me to the movie description and trailer page
In the description page, I can navigate back to the home page.
